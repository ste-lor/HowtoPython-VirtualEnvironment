# HowtoPython-VirtuaEnvironment
Some open source programs are not always immediately compatible with the latest Python version. Thus, it is suitable to create a virtual environment and decouple your main Python and work within the virtual env. This avoids that the different Python versions influence each other.


**For Linux**
  pip install virtualenv
